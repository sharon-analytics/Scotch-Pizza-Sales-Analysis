### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial phase, I prepped the data by:
1. ✅ Removed duplicates to avoid double-counting of orders.
2. ✅ Checked for missing values, especially in time and pizza size columns.
3. ✅ Formatted timestamps by extracting hour values for easier time-based grouping.
4. ✅ Verified consistency in labels for branches and pizza names (no major standardization was needed).

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

- Which branch had the highest number of sales, and which one had the lowest?
- Which pizza flavors were the most and least popular among customers?
- What time(s) of day do most customers place their orders?
- What are the quietest hours of the day, and how might they be optimized?
- Which pizza sizes were most frequently ordered?
- Are there underutilized size categories with potential for growth?
- Do the largest sizes (XL/XXL) present a high-margin opportunity?

  
### Results/Findings

- 🍕Top Branch: House of Pizza recorded the highest number of sales—suggesting strong customer engagement or a strategic location.
- 📉Lowest Performer: Thomas House lagged behind significantly in sales.
- 🔥Best-Selling Pizza: Barbecue Chicken Pizza was the top-selling item overall.
- 🥈Close Competitors: California Chicken Pizza and Classic Deluxe Pizza also performed well.
- 🕛Peak Order Times: Most orders were placed at 12 PM and 1 PM (lunchtime), with additional spikes around 6 PM and 7 PM (evening).
- 🌙Slowest Hours: Very low order volume at 9 AM and 11 PM.
- 📦Most Popular Size: Large pizzas dominated sales—suggesting group or family orders.
- 📉Least Ordered Sizes: Small and Medium pizzas accounted for fewer sales.
- 💡Niche Sizes: XL and XXL pizzas were ordered less frequently but have potential due to their high profit margins.

### Recommendations

- 🏬 **Branch Strategy:** Investigate and replicate **House of Pizza’s** success strategies (e.g., location, marketing, staffing) at **Thomas House** to close the performance gap.

- 🍕 **Menu Promotions:** Promote **top-selling pizzas** in meal bundles or combos with **less popular options** to boost overall sales.

- ⏰ **Time-Based Offers:**
  - Run **lunch specials** during **12–1 PM** to maximize high-traffic periods.
  - Upsell **high-margin items** (like drinks and desserts) during the **evening rush (6–7 PM)**.
  - Use targeted campaigns like **“Early Bird Discounts”** or **late-night deals** to drive traffic during **off-peak times (9 AM, 11 PM)**.

- 📏 **Size-Specific Campaigns:**
  - Offer **combo deals** for **Small** and **Medium** pizzas to attract solo diners or smaller groups.
  - Promote **XL** and **XXL** sizes for **parties/events** where customers are more likely to spend more.
