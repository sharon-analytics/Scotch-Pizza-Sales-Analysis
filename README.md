### Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive sales analysis for Scotch Pizza, a popular pizza chain with branches in four major U.S. cities. The analysis aims to uncover performance trends across branches, pizza preferences, peak ordering times, and customer behavior—ultimately helping the business make data-informed decisions to improve revenue and customer satisfaction.

### Data Sources
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "original dataset.csv", containing detailed information abput each sale made in the company.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: Used for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data. [(Download here)]()
- PowerPoint: Used to present the final insights in a clean and engaging format. [(Download here)]()

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial phase, I prepped the data by:
1. ✅ Removed duplicates to avoid double-counting of orders.
2. ✅ Checked for missing values, especially in time and pizza size columns.
3. ✅ Formatted timestamps by extracting hour values for easier time-based grouping.
4. ✅ Verified consistency in labels for branches and pizza names (no major standardization was needed).

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

- Which branch had the highest number of sales, and which one had the lowest?
- Which pizza flavors were the most and least popular among customers?
- What time(s) of day do most customers place their orders?
- What are the quietest hours of the day, and how might they be optimized?
- Which pizza sizes were most frequently ordered?
- Are there underutilized size categories with potential for growth?
- Do the largest sizes (XL/XXL) present a high-margin opportunity?
  
### Results/Findings

- Top Branch: House of Pizza recorded the highest number of sales—suggesting strong customer engagement or a strategic location.
- Lowest Performer: Thomas House lagged behind significantly in sales.
- Best-Selling Pizza: Barbecue Chicken Pizza was the top-selling item overall.
- Close Competitors: California Chicken Pizza and Classic Deluxe Pizza also performed well.
- Peak Order Times: Most orders were placed at 12 PM and 1 PM (lunchtime), with additional spikes around 6 PM and 7 PM (evening).
- Slowest Hours: Very low order volume at 9 AM and 11 PM.
- Most Popular Size: Large pizzas dominated sales—suggesting group or family orders.
- Least Ordered Sizes: Small and Medium pizzas accounted for fewer sales.
- Niche Sizes: XL and XXL pizzas were ordered less frequently but have potential due to their high profit margins.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I found this recommendations helpful:
1. Branch Strategy: Investigate and replicate House of Pizza’s success strategies (e.g., location, marketing, staffing) at Thomas House to close the performance gap.

2. Menu Promotions: Promote top-selling pizzas in meal bundles or combos with less popular options to boost overall sales.

3. Time-Based Offers:

  - Run lunch specials during 12–1 PM to maximize high-traffic periods.

  - Upsell high-margin items (like drinks and desserts) during the evening rush (6–7 PM).

  - Use targeted campaigns like “Early Bird Discounts” or late-night deals to drive traffic during off-peak times (9 AM, 11 PM).
    

4. Size-Specific Campaigns:

  - Offer combo deals for small and medium pizzas to attract solo diners or smaller groups.

  - Promote XL and XXL sizes for parties/events where customers are more likely to spend more.
